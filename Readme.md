## An extension for Chrome (Safari coming soon)

### FAQ

**Why is Goodness blocking something I didn't tell it to?**

That's hard for me to say. Examine your configured filters (in Edit Mode, on the Goodness Options page) and try to determine what could be triggering the filter.

**Can I set the filter to run only during certain times?**

Sorry, that's the job of a productivity-boosting filter. While Goodness is in the Productivity category, its duty is to be a morale-boosting filter. Blocked terms are blocked, period.

**Can I set Goodness to always trust certain websites, like Gmail?**

We're working on adding a url whitelist. Stay tuned.
